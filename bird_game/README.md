# Bird game

Following along with [this simple game tutorial](https://simplegametutorials.github.io/love/bird/) for a flappy bird clone, but translated to [fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/)

## Getting started

Make sure you have [Love 2D](https://love2d.org/) installed. I developed this on version 11.3:

```bash
$ love --version
LOVE 11.3 (Mysterious Mysteries)
```

To run the game from this directory:

```bash
love .
```
